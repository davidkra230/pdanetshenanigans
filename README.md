> pdanet and foxfi activation/registration server with a dns server for quick and easy testing and modification.

- Ever wanted to have the full version of pdanet+/foxfi?
- Do you own foxfi key but want to save the ~700kb of storage it uses?
- Are you someone who doesn't own foxfi or pdanet+ but want to pirate it? (don't do this, 100% for educational purposes, pls no ban)
- Do you want to tinker with and experient with random programs/code?

### If you ever wanted to do these things, this is for you!

###### I'll more readme content soon maybe?
